### Abstract

In this study, we aim to develop an effective model for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. Two models were built and trained: a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, achieving 97.0% accuracy, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, achieving 99.5% accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the classic VGG architecture, we designed a simplified CNN model that reduces computational complexity while maintaining high performance. The results demonstrate the superiority of CNNs for digit recognition tasks and highlight the effectiveness of tailored architectures for balancing efficiency and accuracy. This work provides insights into model design and optimization for similar recognition problems.
